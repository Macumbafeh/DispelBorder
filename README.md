# DispelBorder Classic
Shows highlight border around enemy magic buffs like on retail. (For patch 2.4.3 and 1.12.1, also equivalent retail classic patches)

This addon is meant to be as simple as possible, so things like auto-disabling the addon while not having a dispel/spellsteal ability are not included.
Also, **only Blizzard frames + FocusFrame are currently supported.**
